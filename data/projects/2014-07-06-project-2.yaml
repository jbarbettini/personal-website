description: In this application, I designed and architected client-side application with React, Redux and SASS, and minimized queries to Neo4j graph database and PostgreSQL to enable a more seamless user experience. I was also able to create a Tinder-like experience with live match notifications using sockets and Redis, as well as implemented animations with React Motion to simulate gesture-based actions. <br><br> Check it out [here](http://reddi2mingle.com)
