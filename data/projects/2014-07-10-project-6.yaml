description: "Personally, I waste an embarrassing amount of time trying to decide what to eat, and beyond that, what's even worth going out to get. I know I'm not unique in this dilemma, so I'm hopeful this app will solve that problems for other people (and their significant others), too. <br><br> This project is done with pure Javascript, HTML, and CSS, and is my first foray into the world of coding.
