description: "Hello Fearless is the company that I cofounded back in 2014. We graduated from the [Sparklab KC](http://www.sparklabkc.com) accelerator program in April, raised our seed investment round, built our brand, developed our first product [Boss School](http://www.hfbossschool.com), and opened our first class in that time.
